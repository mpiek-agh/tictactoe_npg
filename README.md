## Introduction
The basic version of the tic-tac-toe game is a simple game in which two players (one using the symbol "X" and the other "O") take turns placing their symbols on a grid, usually with dimensions of 3x3. The goal of the game is to arrange three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does. The player who achieves this goal wins the round.


In our aplication, this basic version has been modified with additional options such as a time-based game mode, the ability to undo moves, and different board dimensions. These modifications were introduced to make the gameplay more diverse and challenging.
